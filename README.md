# Screens

## Home Screen
This screen holds the main structure of the website. It contains different options to perform different tasks to request and send claims to other users or receive and send information to other users. This screen contains the AVATAR for the person, which is made by using GenAI

## Docker Screen
This screen gives you all the documents uploaded by you, you can upload more documents to it. For managing documents, I have used IPFS as storing big files on the Blockchain is expensive

## Voter Screen
It gives you the option to create new poll. It also shows all the polls in our contract, with it's result. This provides for no tampering mechanism by not showing which user have voted for which option.

## Building Access Screen
This screen shows all your permanent properties, and all your temporary (i.e. someone else have given you access for sometime)
From this screen you can manage all your properties and all the properties you have access with. You can also check who entered your property using the form in bottom left
